        WHU Dreamer（WeChat Mini App）is an application made by Wuhan University Student Union. This application provides lots of tools to make our work more efficient. I am a server-side maintainer of campus forum. The forum is popular among students and teachers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The excellent point of the forum is the topic system. If the server detects the text between two sharp symbols, this post will connect to the topic which is detected. The topic system aggregates all the posts. Let users browsers all the messages more conveniently.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also detecting the URL in posts is another big problem. Finally, I decide to let the URL detection RFC compatible. Moreover, for easy use, I maintained a TLD list to distinguish which part belongs to the URL and which part is normal text if users text Chinese characters after a URL without typing whitespace.

the connection pool by myself, and abstract 
the endpoint of the network to a few

Finally, this application runs well 
for some months on my server and was used 
by dozens of users.

Onebot Command Routing: github/ParaParty/OneBot-Framework
A Onebot developing framework base on 
ASP.Core. Provide a Spring Web binding 
(Asp.Net MVC also) like command router 
for easily add a new command to the 
chatting robot.
Using the knowledge of software engineering, 
data structures and, compiler front end. I 
code a high-performance command router by 
preparing the parameter type before starting 
to receive messages and manage all commands 
into a tiered tree.

VolcEngine ImageX PHP Developing Tools:
volcengine.cn/docs/508/67290
VolcEngine is an important ToB Business 
of ByteDance, and ImageX is one of the items 
of VolcEngine. For common use, I made a 
flysystem adapter for ImageX to let the PHP 
application base on Laravel, Luma, ThinkPHP, 
or other frameworks can integrate ImageX 
easily. This project is an important part 
of VolcEnging ImageX recommended on VolcEngins's 
website.


[Projects]
Main collaborator of Wuhan University Library
User Activating Platform 
https://system.lib.whu.edu.cn/game2018/web-mobile/index.html
Wuhan University Library account needs 
to be activated after initializing. Unless 
a freshman activates his / her account, this 
account is not allowed to borrow a book from 
the library. And my friends and I made an 
application to let freshmen activate their 
accounts after entering school.
In this project, I used the knowledge of 
computer network and software engineering, 
designed a protocol to make sure a user can 
only answer the quiz in a minute and made a 
leaderboard.
Member of WHU Dreamer
09/2020 - {PRESENT}
WHU Dreamer（WeChat Mini App）is an 
application made by Wuhan University 
Student Union. This application provides 
lots of tools to make our work more 
efficient. I am a server-side maintainer 
of campus forum. The forum is popular 
among students and teachers.The excellent point of the forum is 
the topic system. If the server detects 
the text between two sharp symbols, this 
post will connect to the topic which is 
detected. The topic system aggregates all 
the posts. Let users browsers all the 
messages more conveniently.
Also detecting the URL in posts is another 
big problem. Finally, I decide to let the URL 
detection RFC compatible. Moreover, for easy 
use, I maintained a TLD list to distinguish 
which part belongs to the URL and which part 
is normal text if users text Chinese characters 
after a URL without typing whitespace.

[Miscellaneous]
CKYU community 
Chatting and programming board manager
11/2018 - 08/2020
CKYU community affected Chinese chatting 
robot in designing and reaction. After 
the community closing in 2020-08, lots 
of applications are still preserve an 
CKYU like application interface.
I maintained a Delphi / Pascal SDK 
for this kind of application and let 
Delphi / Pascal programmer use this 
application easily.
In communication between the member 
of this community, I learned a lot of 
programming skills when I was in middle 
school and make plenty of friends which 
are kept in touch now. It is a treasure 
during my whole computer studying journey.

Onebot Concept Collaborator 
github/howmanybots/onebot
An adapter concept about chatting robots. 
Providing a similar API between various 
kinds of chatting robot platforms for 
easy migration from this one to another 
one.
The main idea of this protocol is building 
a set of adapters to make many kinds of IM 
chatting robot systems expose a certain 
commonly used API.
This project is in the list of Summer 2021 
of Open Source Promotion Plan, which is held 
by the Institute of Software Chinese Academy 
of Sciences

Tencent Techo 2020 Programming Competition 
https://cloud.tencent.com/act/event/developer2020
The Best Technical Improvements (aka. the second prize). 
The only one group which is make of student 
won a prize in this competition.
The application we made is the demo of the 
campus forum. We learned the core idea of 
Discuz Q and construct a new application that 
fit our campus community. At last, we migrated 
the whole application to our own code and 
integrated into the WeChat mini program I 
mentioned before. 

Like sharing with others
I like to share my skill with others 
and also good at learning from others. 
I am also very delight to make a patch 
for my favorite application. I like to 
make the application I love to be better. 
Thus, my code was accepted by some repositories, 
such as a widely used plug-in 
Dynmap (github/webbukkit/dynmap) 
on Minecraft.
